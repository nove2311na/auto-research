# Agent System Spec

## Summary

MAS-Figma-Webflow-khang is a standalone Claude-native, Python-first agentic folder for converting Figma designs into Webflow builds using MAS V3 orchestration, Finsweet Client-First V2 rules, structured class mapping, workspace JSON chunking, MCP-352 micro-chunking, reflection, and strict QA.

## Agents

| Agent | Role | Trigger | Allowed Tools | Forbidden Actions | Output |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `pm` | User-facing orchestrator and phase controller. | Any user request or phase transition. | Read, write plans/handoff, run safe gates. | Bypass approval, direct Webflow writes, direct QA approval. | Phase report, task requests, handoff. |
| `client-first-architect` | Blueprint and QA owner. | Phase 1 blueprint or Phase 3 QA. | Read/write blueprints, inspect Webflow evidence. | Build in Webflow, approve without evidence. | Blueprint JSON, QA verdict. |
| `figma-webflow-operator` | Figma extraction and Webflow execution. | Phase 1 extraction, Phase 2 build, fix loops. | Read/write workspace, external Figma/Webflow when approved. | Use `whtml_builder`, exceed MCP-352, mutate unknown targets. | Raw/content JSON, state log. |
| `workspace-steward` | Workspace lifecycle and handoff integrity. | Archive, restore, init, page transition. | Workspace scripts and handoff updates. | Delete unarchived state, restore into non-empty workspace. | Lifecycle report. |
| `qa-gatekeeper` | Deterministic gates and standalone readiness. | After scaffold/build/QA report. | Read and run gates. | Edit producer artifacts, mark unchecked gates as pass. | Validation report. |

## Skills

| Skill | Purpose | Validation |
|---|---|---|
| `figma-to-webflow-build` | Run the full MAS V3 workflow. | Gate results and handoff update. |
| `client-first-blueprint` | Produce Client-First blueprints from Figma data. | Blueprint evidence and Client-First checks. |
| `mcp-352-webflow-build` | Build in Webflow using native micro-chunks. | State log and QA evidence. |
| `pixel-perfect-qa` | Validate Webflow output against Figma/blueprint. | `[APPROVED]` or `[FIX]` with evidence. |
| `reflection-review` | Critique risky artifacts with a bounded reflection loop. | Pass, revise, or block with score and evidence. |

## Tools

| `python scripts/archive_workspace.py` | Archive and wipe workspace after zip validation. | R4 | explicit approval | none | workspace-steward |
| `python scripts/restore_workspace.py` | Restore archived workspace. | R4 | explicit approval | none | workspace-steward |
| `python scripts/gates/*.py` | Deterministic validation. | R0 | allow | none | qa-gatekeeper, pm |
| `knowledge-base/client-first-class-map.json` | Structured Figma property to Client-First class mapping. | R0 | allow read | none | architect, operator, gatekeeper |
| `Figma API/MCP` | Extract design data. | R2 | ask | Figma token or approved connector | figma-webflow-operator |
| `Webflow MCP` | Inspect and mutate Webflow site. | R3 | explicit approval for writes | Webflow auth | operator, architect for read/QA |

## MCP Servers

| Server | Purpose | risk_class | approval_policy | auth_requirements | allowed_agents | config_path |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `webflow` | Webflow inspect/build operations through Claude Code MCP after auth setup. | R3 | ask; writes require explicit phase approval | Webflow OAuth/session | operator, architect read/QA | `agentic/policies/mcp-config.example.json` example |
| `filesystem` | Local project file access. | R0/R1 | allow read, ask write | none | all agents by role | `agentic/policies/mcp-config.example.json` |
| `figma` | Figma data extraction if configured. | R2 | ask | Figma token/OAuth | operator | documented skip until configured |

## Workflows

## Scaffold Files

See `agentic/specs/scaffold-file-plan.md`.

## Standalone Architecture Baseline

This folder targets self-contained readiness:

- Structure parity: `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/`, `agentic/memory/team-memory.md`, `agentic/`, `knowledge-base/`, and `scripts/gates/` exist.
- Quality target: 4.7.
- Exceedance: agent system spec, tool/MCP matrix, workflow contracts, memory promotion, MCP risk map, scaffold file plan, reflection loop, ReAct trace, JSON schemas, visual QA evidence, and Client-First class library exist.
- Runtime specialization: Claude Code-only and Python-first.
